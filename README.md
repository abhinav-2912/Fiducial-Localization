# Fiducial-Localization

This repository contains code for the competition **Fiducial Marker Localization in CT/MRI Brain Images** during Inter IIT Tech Meet 2018 held at IIT Madras. We stood 3rd among the 15 IITs that participated. The aim of this project is to find the location of fiducials in a 3D CT/MRI scan of the brain. This can prove beneficial in helping doctors to determine the position of brain tumours faster. In the dataset, there were brain scans, with fiducials in them, captured through different axes.
